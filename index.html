    <h4>My Work</h4>
    <br>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="column"><p>Hire Me</p><br>
        I currently at the age of 16, have a total of 6 years of personal experience where I have programmed almost every day with more than thousands of lines of codes written for my pet projects as well as published projects such as ReSourced.<br><br>

        I started learning Python 3 in the December of 2018. I am familiar with many code packs in Python 3. I started learning C# in the September of 2020 which brought me to a point where I am pretty familiar with the C# Programming Language. I also started learning JavaScript in the December of 2020. I am pretty familiar with JavaScript now too. I also know C, I started to learn C at the beginning of January 2021. I am pretty familiar with the standard packages in C. I also know SQL specifically SQLite as well as MySQL including interacting with the desktop client-side application development interface. I know basic web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with the Flask module in Python which allows you to build server apps. I also know the English of programming languages, colloquially known as Java, I started learning Java in February 2021. However, of all the languages that I know, my favorite and most familiar language is Python. Until now I have not worked anywhere, I have just been programming on my own so I don’t have any job experience. Also if you have any ideas for me to build, don’t be afraid to contact me below.</div>
        <div class="column2"><p>Work With Me</p><br>My skills are I’m pretty good with computers. I have good programming skills I can program in five different languages and looking to learn a sixth one soon. If you have a programming language that you think I should learn contact me below and tell me. I have good communication skills, and I can communicate with anyone efficiently and effectively. I have great presentation skills, I know I have good presentation skills because I have a YouTube channel, Autobox, which you can see for yourself at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfIiucTwiZVK5jK1or">Autobox Channel</a>. One great habit that I have is that I never give up, I have one favorite quote, that quote is by Elon Musk, who said “If something is important enough, you should do it even if the odds are against you”. One other good habit that I have is that I always do and turn things in on time, but my work is not sloppy, it does not look like it was rushed, and my work is quality work that will be turned in on time. I am a full-stack software engineer, and I know front-end engineering and back-end engineering so, if you have any ideas for either an app, game or website contact me, and I will give you a professional product on time.<br><br>

        In terms of volunteer experience, I have also worked with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and been an essential part of the team in charge of organizing the 2024 FIDE Candidates held in Toronto, which for the first time was a North American Venue.</div>
        <div class="column"><p>Follow Me</p><br>My portfolio showcases various personal projects created throughout my 2 years of experience. Subscribe to my site to get updated when I add new stuff, And also make sure you subscribe to my YouTube channel, Autobox. I will always update my site when I make a new project and when I learn a new programming language, if you read my “Hire Me” paragraph, you will know that I currently know five programming languages excluding HTML, CSS, and SQL because those are not really considered programming languages. If you ever wanted to see some cool projects like websites, programs, or games then you should come here where you can see some of my biggest projects you can also go through all my code in languages uncomment out the code, and run the program so you can see what the program does or just play around with it. One of my most notable projects was the nonprofit organization I started with my friends called ReSourced where I was responsible for building all the software as CTO to market it as CMO. you can find the sites at <a href="https://replit.com/@resourced">https://replit.com/@resourced</a> Another project that has been lifechanging is a club that I founded with one of my friends where I have gathered numerous sponsorships including a partnership with the chess club of the University of Waterloo and a multinational company, and more than 40 members across Canada as well as the world which was named Zugzwang Chess Club, the site for which can be found at <a href="https://zugzwangcc.wordpress.com">https://zugzwangcc.wordpress.com</a>, I have the objective of making this club one of the biggest online communities in the world for chess. I am a pretty young programmer, an aspiring software engineer, a reliable dependable working person as well as an optimist for the future.</div>

    <h4>About Me, Sarveshwar Senthilkumar</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6>Hi my name is <h7>Sarveshwar Senthilkumar</h7>.


      I’m a 16-year-old kid, who learned how to program in December of 2018 for my Genius Hour project, and when the project ended, realized I liked programming so continued to do it as a hobby developing many projects, you can see all my code above on my website. One of my biggest projects is my text-based “Talking Robot”, This was the project I was dedicated to for around 2 years where I continued to add features and explore new modules daily which taught me a lot of valuable skills and lessons. However, one of my most notable projects was the nonprofit organization I started with my friends called ReSourced where I was responsible for building all the software as CTO to market it as CMO. you can find the sites at resourced.repl.co This project was one of my most notable as I was invited to the local news network to share it. Another project is the Zugzwang Chess Club which is a club that originally started in school with a friend and expanded into an international endeavor where we have over 40 members from all across Canada as well as members from all around the world Britain to Norway to India to China, I have also managed to acquire numerous sponsorships for this project including a club from the University of Waterloo as well as the multinational conglomerate, Chess.com, as well as a chess-based startup as one of their product development testers. I aspire to become a software engineer and possibly an entrepreneur or executive of a tech company, and I am always looking for my next endeavor.
